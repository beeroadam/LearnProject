## Spring Core and Bean Lifecycle Cheat sheet

### Basic Concepts

- **Spring Framework**: Provides comprehensive infrastructural support for developing applications.
- **Spring IOC Container**: The heart of the Spring Framework that creates, manages, and configured beans.
- **Bean**: An object that is instantiated, configured, and managed by a Spring IOC container.

Sure, here's some additional information about Spring Core:

### Spring Core Injection Types

Spring Core framework provides two types of Dependency Injection:

- **Setter Injection**: With setter injection, the container will call setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.
```java
public class TextEditor {
  private SpellChecker spellChecker;

  public void setSpellChecker(SpellChecker spellChecker) {
     this.spellChecker = spellChecker;
  }
}
```

- **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided as constructor arguments.
```java
public class TextEditor {
  private SpellChecker spellChecker;

  public TextEditor(SpellChecker spellChecker) {
     this.spellChecker = spellChecker;
  }
}
```

### Bean Scopes

Bean scopes in spring are:

- **singleton**: (Default) Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance per Spring IoC container.
- **prototype**: A single bean definition to any number of object instances.
- **request**: Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a single HTTP request; that is, each HTTP request has its own instance of a bean created off the back of a single bean definition.
- **session**: Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of an HTTP Session.
- **global-session**: Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a global HTTP Session.

Note: In a standalone application, only singleton and prototype scopes are available.

### Autowiring

Autowiring is Springâ€™s mechanism which lets you inject the object dependency implicitly.

- **No**: No autowiring. The ref attribute should be used to wire bean references.
- **byName**: Autowiring by property name. If property name of a bean is same as a bean name in the XML configuration file, Spring will automatically wire them using `byName`.
- **byType**: Autowiring by property datatype. If there is exactly one bean of the property type in the container, then it will be injected into the property.
- **constructor**: Similar to byType, but type applies to constructor arguments. If there is exactly one bean of the constructor argument type in the container, it will be injected.

### @Autowired annotation / @Inject

The `@Autowired` annotation provides more fine-grained control over where and how autowiring should be accomplished. It can be used to autowire bean on the setter method, constructor, a property, or methods with arbitrary names and/or multiple arguments.`@Inject` does the same job but it is a standard annotation.

### Understanding Spring Bean Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Spring Bean is as follows:

1. **Instantiate**: The Spring container begins the bean lifecycle by instantiating the bean from the class definition.
2. **Populate properties**: The container reads the properties provided in the bean definition file and injects them into the bean.
3. **Set Bean Name**: In case the bean implements `BeanNameAware`, Spring passes the bean's id to `setBeanName()` method.
4. **Set Bean factory**: In case the bean implements `BeanFactoryAware`, Spring passes the beanfActory to `setBeanFactory()` method.
5. **Pre Initialization - BeanPostProcessors**: The `postProcessBeforeInitialization()` method of all BeanPostProcessors are executed before invoking custom initialization methods.
6. **Initialize beans**:
    - if the bean implements `InitializingBean`, Spring calls the `afterPropertiesSet()` method.
    - If the bean's initialization is marked with an `@PostConstruct` annotation, Spring calls that method.
    - If the bean has a custom `init` method declaration, Spring calls that method.
7. **Post Initialization - BeanPostProcessors**: The `postProcessAfterInitialization()` method of all BeanPostProcessors are invoked.
8. **Ready to use**: The bean is ready to be used by the application.
9. **Destroy**: When the container shuts down, it calls the destruction callbacks.
    - if the bean implements `DisposableBean`, Spring calls the `destroy()` method.
    - If the method marked with `@PreDestroy` annotation, then that method is called.
    - If the bean has a custom `destroy` method declaration, Spring calls that method.

Remember, the "init" and "destroy" method names are conventional, but you can provide custom names for these methods.

You can also control the lifecycle of a bean using `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations which are a part of the JSR-250 specification. These are preferred over `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` callback interfaces.
